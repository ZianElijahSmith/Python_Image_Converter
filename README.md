# Python_Image_Converter
## This is still a work in progress!
Everything works except webp to jpg (gonna fix that)
<br>
Please note .jpeg and .jpg are the exact same format, so there's no need to convert from jpeg to jpg and vice versa.

**Background**
I got tired of using a web converter like https://convertio.co/ to convert images, so I am making my own. It's still a work in progress as I add features, formats, and use cases. 

My initial intent when coding this was just simply making a function that I could import into iPython and then give the function:
1. A path to the image I want to convert
2. A format I want to convert it in.

As I began coding, I thought of more ideas and use cases. So currently debating myself how I should go about this.


Will try to convert this code into something more modular later so it can be easily copied and pasted when making modules, classes, functions, etc.
