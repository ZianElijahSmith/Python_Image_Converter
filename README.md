# Python_Image_Converter
## Everything works now!
<br>
Please note .jpeg and .jpg are the exact same format, so there's no need to convert from jpeg to jpg and vice versa.

## Background
<br><br>
I got tired of using a web converter like https://convertio.co/ to convert images, so I am making my own. It's still a work in progress as I add features, formats, and use cases. 

My initial intent when coding this was just simply making a function that I could import into iPython and then give the function:
1. A path to the image I want to convert
2. A format I want to convert it in.

As I began coding, I thought of more ideas and use cases. So currently debating myself if I should just leave this as a function or add a gui for desktop.

## To use
Copy and paste this code into an interpreter like ipython, or import it into your interpreter.
Then call the function with the arguments. Example:
convert_image('/home/user/test/chad.webp', '.jpg') #You should see chad.wbp.jpg in the directory now


Will try to convert this code into something more modular later so it can be easily copied and pasted when making modules, classes, functions, etc.

For now, enjoy and hope you find this useful for either converting images or learning Python!
